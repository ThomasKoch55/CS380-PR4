# CS380-PR4
Project 4 CS380 Junior Year

The first part of this project (PR1) was focused on writing C code that took a large file of URLS (about a million) and analyzing for common 'n-grams'. 
An 'n-gram' was defined as a set of concurrent characters, with the length specified by the user. 

The second part of this project (pr4) required students to take the code from the first project and modify it to run in parallel using pthreads. We were given a hash function library 
(uthash.h) to assist with our project. We also created a pdf (pr4.pdf) analysing our results and reflecting on the project.
